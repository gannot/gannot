# Gannot
Gannot is a small library with limited functionality focused on genome annotation. It is a result of factoring out code that I have found useful in various Rust projects.

It is unlikely to be more generally useful at this stage, but it provides a base for me to add further shared code&mdash;and to learn the Cargo ecosystem. If I have a chance to extend it, there are likely to be many breaking changes, so it is *not recommended* to use this package.

Currently, it provides convenience functions for specifying genomic coordinates and for parsing GFF3 and BED files.
